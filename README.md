Purpose of program:             Creates a map(forest) using a 2d array with the dimensions given by user.
                                It then creates person in the top left and bottom right of the map.  These people move
                                around the map randomly until they meet or the time limit is reached(1000000).  Then the
                                program displays the coordinate location the people met, time taken to find each other,
                                and also the average time taken to find each other in 100 runs.  It also displays a map
                                of the coordinates using text showing the start and finish states of the program.
